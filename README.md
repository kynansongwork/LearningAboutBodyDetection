#  Rowing Posture App/ Learning how to use pose detection

Currently using the PoseFinder App and PoseNet model to learn about how to detect and map body postions with the hope to write an app that can determine and compare ones posture and arm positions whilst rowing to comparisson data.

To start, I am working through the PoseFinder source code to learn what each bit does, before creating UI and further data models to move the app the direction I want.
